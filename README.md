# Ghost Google Drive
[Google drive storage](https://github.com/robincsamuel/ghost-google-drive) for ghost allows you to store the contents on google drive. I believe its helpful if you are gonna host your ghost app on heroku.  

Will work with version higher than `0.6.0` of Ghost!

## Installation

### Via Git

In order to replace the storage module, the basic requirements are:

- Create a new folder inside `/content` called `/storage`
- Clone this repo to `/storage`

  ```
  cd [path/to/ghost]/content/storage
  git clone https://github.com/robincsamuel/ghost-google-drive.git
  ```
- Install dependencies

  ```
  cd ghost-google-drive
  npm install
  ```
  
You can add `ghost-google-drive`, `bluebird`, `googleapis` to dependencies in Ghost's `package.json`.

## Create OAuth credentials

- Login to [google console](https://code.google.com/apis/console)
- Create new project from the top right dropdown

- Click `Enable`

- Input necessary data

- After clicking `Create` button, google will generate a json file with the credentials for you. **Save it and don't lose!** 

## Configuration

In your `config.js` file, you'll need to add a new `storage` block to whichever environment you want to change:

```js
storage: {
  active: 'ghost-google-drive',
  'ghost-google-drive': {
    key: {
            "private_key_id": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID",
            "private_key": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY",
            "client_email": "YOUR CLIENT EMAIL",
            "client_id": "YOUR CLIENT ID",
          }
  }
}
```
We just need to replace the key object with your json array generated by google console.
